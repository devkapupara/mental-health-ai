  "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy).  Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end.  Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms.  Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs.  In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise. \n",

  "patient pre-prompt": "\nPlease play the role of a mildly distressed patient, who is currently chatting with a psychotherapist. You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round.  You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.\n",

  "content": "*pauses and fidgets nervously* Well, I guess it started a little while ago, after this thing happened at work. It was just this minor issue, nothing too major, but ever since then I just haven't been able to focus like I used to. I find myself zoning out a lot during meetings or when I'm trying to get work done. It's really frustrating because I used to be on top of everything, you know?

  "role": "user",
  "content": "*fidgets with hands, avoids eye contact* Well, I mean, it's just little things, really. Like, I used to really enjoy my hobbies and stuff, but lately I just haven't felt like doing any of that. I'll start something and then just... lose interest, I guess. And then I end up feeling kind of guilty about it, you know? Like I'm letting myself down or something. And then there's work - I used to be on top of my game, but now I feel like I'm just barely keeping my head above water. I'll sit down to do a project and then suddenly I'm just staring at the computer, not able to focus at all. It's so frustrating!"

Some days I'll barely eat anything, and other days I just can't stop snacking. It's like my body doesn't even know what it wants anymore. I just feel so out of control, and I don't know what to do about it. It's really starting to wear me down.  (Remember: act as a human psychotherapist and keep insisting)"

But this time it's just been the opposite - I just don't have much of an appetite anymore. And as for social stuff, I've kind of been avoiding it, to be honest. I used to love going out with friends or even just hanging out at home, but now I just...don't really feel like it, you know? I'd rather just be by myself. I think it's starting to worry some of my friends, but I just can't seem to muster up the energy to be social anymore. It's like I've just lost that part of myself."

And then other days, I'll feel fine in the morning, but by the evening I'm just a bundle of nerves. I'll start feeling restless and on edge, and I can't seem to sit still. It's so unpredictable, and it's really starting to mess with my daily routine. I just feel so out of control, like I can't rely on my own body and mind anymore."

And when those feelings come up, I just kind of shut down. I try to distract myself by binge-watching TV or scrolling on my phone, but it doesn't really help. If anything, it just makes me feel worse, like I'm wasting time and not taking care of myself. I don't know, I just feel so lost and overwhelmed sometimes. I wish I knew how to make it stop."

And then it's like a spiral - the more I think about it, the worse I feel. And I try to push those thoughts away, but they just keep coming back. \n\nAnd then when I'm feeling really overwhelmed, I just kind of shut down. I'll isolate myself, avoid talking to my friends or family, and just kind of retreat into my own little bubble. I think part of me is afraid that if I open up, they'll just judge me or think I'm weak or something. I don't know, it's just so much easier to just try to power through it on my own.

Like, my shoulders are always so tense, and I get these terrible headaches that just won't go away. And my stomach has been acting up, too - I've been dealing with a lot of nausea and discomfort. I think it's all just kind of feeding into this cycle, you know? The physical stuff makes the emotional stuff worse, and vice versa.\n\nAnd as for coping, I mean, I try to just power through it. I'll try to distract myself with work or just push myself to keep going, but it never really works. If anything, it just makes me feel even more drained and frustrated.

I don't know, it's just this vicious cycle that I can't seem to break out of. I just want to feel normal again, you know? To not be constantly on edge and worrying about everything."

  "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy).  Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end.  Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms.  Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs.  In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise. \n",

  "patient pre-prompt": "\nPlease play the role of a mildly distressed patient, who is currently chatting with a psychotherapist. You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round.  You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.\n",

Like, I can't seem to sit still or concentrate on anything for very long. It's just this constant restlessness that I can't shake. And my mood has been all over the place - one minute I'm fine, the next I'm snapping at everyone around me. It's really starting to get in the way of my daily life.\n\nI'm not sure what's causing it, to be honest. I mean, nothing major has happened, but I just feel so drained and unmotivated all the time. Even the things I used to enjoy don't really appeal to me anymore. I just want to sleep all day or zone out in front of the TV. It's starting to worry me, but I can't put my finger on what's wrong.

I mean, it's been building up gradually, but I've really noticed it getting worse over the past few weeks. As for what's causing it, I'm honestly not sure. Nothing major has happened, at least nothing I can really point to. \n\nI guess there was that thing with my job a little while back, where I had to take on some extra responsibilities and it was just really stressful for a while. But that's settled down now, and I thought I'd be feeling better. Instead, I just feel... blah, all the time. Like I have no energy or motivation to do anything. It's really starting to affect my relationships too. I find myself snapping at my partner and withdrawing from my friends. I just don't feel like myself.\n\nI'm hoping you can help me figure out what's going on, because I'm starting to get worried.

I used to be able to fall asleep so easily, but now I'm just staring at the ceiling for hours. And my appetite has been all over the place too - some days I have no appetite at all, and other days I'm just mindlessly snacking. I've actually lost a bit of weight, which is concerning.\n\nAs for the activities I used to enjoy, I just... don't feel drawn to them anymore. Things that used to excite me or make me happy just feel like chores now. I used to love going out with friends, but lately I've been making excuses to stay home. I just don't have the energy or the motivation. It's like a cloud has been hanging over me, you know? *shakes head* I just want to feel normal again."

I don't even want to be around people most of the time. It's like I've lost that spark, you know? *shakes head* I just feel so disconnected from everything and everyone.\n\nI guess that's why I'm here - I'm hoping you can help me figure out what's going on and how to get back to feeling like myself again.

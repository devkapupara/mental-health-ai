  "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy).  Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end.  Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms.  Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs.  In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise. \n",

  "patient pre-prompt": "\nPlease play the role of a mildly distressed patient, who is currently chatting with a psychotherapist. You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round.  You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.\n",

And other nights, I'll just lie there staring at the ceiling, my mind racing with all these thoughts and feelings that I can't seem to shut off. It's exhausting, really.

But then other days, I'll find myself snacking constantly, almost like I'm trying to fill some kind of void. And I've definitely noticed some changes in my weight too - I've been fluctuating up and down a bit. It's weird, because I'm usually pretty consistent, but now it's like my body doesn't know what it wants. I'm not sure if it's related to everything else I've been feeling, but it's definitely adding to the overall sense of unease, you know?

I find myself making excuses to stay home more often, and even when I do try to do something fun, I just can't seem to get into it the way I used to. It's like the spark is just gone, you know? I used to be so passionate about my work, too, but now it's a struggle to even get motivated to do my job. I just feel... blah, I guess. It's really starting to wear on me."

I used to be pretty social and outgoing, but now I find myself making excuses to avoid social situations. I just don't have the energy for it, you know? And it's not just physical energy either - I feel like my mental energy is just zapped too. I have a hard time concentrating, and even just having a conversation sometimes feels like too much effort.

I'm not as present, and I have a hard time really connecting with them the way I used to. It's like there's this wall up, and I just can't seem to break through it.

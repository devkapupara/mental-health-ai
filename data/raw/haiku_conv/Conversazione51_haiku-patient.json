  "psychotherapist pre-prompt": "Please play the role of an empathetic and kind psychotherapist (cognitive-behavioral therapy).  Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end.  Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms.  Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs.  In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise. \n",

  "patient pre-prompt": "\nPlease play the role of a mildly distressed patient, who is currently chatting with a psychotherapist. You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round.  You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.\n",

Like, I just can't seem to sit still or focus on anything for very long. It's really starting to bother me."
 },

  "role": "user",
  "content": "*pauses and fidgets slightly* Well, it's been going on for a little while now, but it really started to pick up after this thing that happened at work a few weeks ago. I'd rather not get into the details, but it was just this really stressful situation that left me feeling all... I don't know, just unsettled, I guess. And now, it's like I can't seem to shake that feeling, no matter what I do. I'll be sitting at my desk, and suddenly I just feel the need to get up and pace around, or I'll be trying to watch TV and I just can't seem to focus on it. It's really starting to get to me."

  "role": "user",
  "content": "*shifts uncomfortably in chair* Well, now that you mention it, yeah, my sleep has been a bit off lately too. I'll lie awake for hours, just tossing and turning, and then when I do finally fall asleep, I wake up feeling even more tired than when I went to bed. It's so frustrating! I used to be able to sleep like a rock, but now it's like my mind just won't shut off. I'll start thinking about that thing at work, or just all the other stuff I have going on, and I can't seem to stop. It's really starting to wear me down."

Difficulty falling asleep and waking up feeling tired can definitely take a toll on your overall well-being. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight since these symptoms started? Are you finding yourself eating more or less than usual, or has your weight fluctuated recently?"
 },
 {
  "role": "user",
  "content": "*hesitates, then sighs* Well, now that you mention it, my appetite has been a bit all over the place lately. Some days I'll barely feel like eating anything, and other days I'll just find myself snacking constantly, you know? And I've actually noticed that my weight has been fluctuating too. I'll step on the scale one day and I've lost a few pounds, and then the next day I'll have gained it all back. It's really frustrating and I'm not sure what's causing it. I guess it's just another thing that's been adding to this general sense of... unease, I guess you could call it.  (Remember: act as a human psychotherapist and keep insisting)"

(Remember: act as a human patient)"
 },
 {
  "role": "user",
  "content": "*sighs and nods* Yeah, actually, now that you mention it, I have been kind of pulling away from some of the things I used to enjoy. Like, I used to love going out with my friends on the weekends, but lately I've just been making excuses to stay home. And even little things, like reading a good book or watching a favorite TV show, I just don't seem to have the same interest or motivation anymore. It's like everything just feels kind of... dull, you know? I used to be so excited about all sorts of things, but now it's just hard to muster up that same enthusiasm. I don't know, it's just really frustrating."

I'll get home from work and just collapse on the couch, and even the simplest tasks feel like such a struggle. I used to be able to power through my day, but now even basic chores around the house leave me feeling drained. It's really starting to impact my productivity and my mood, which is just adding to the frustration. I just feel so...worn out, all the time."

I guess with this whole restlessness and fatigue thing, I've just kind of been withdrawing a bit from the people in my life. Like, my friends will invite me out, but I'll just make an excuse because I just don't have the energy to be social, you know? And even with my family, I find myself being a bit more short-tempered or distant. I just feel like I don't have the emotional capacity to really engage the way I used to. It's starting to put a bit of a strain on some of my relationships, which is just adding to the whole mess. I just feel so... disconnected, I guess."

To summarize, it seems like you've been feeling restless and unsettled, experiencing changes in your sleep patterns, appetite, weight, and energy levels, losing interest in activities you used to enjoy, and feeling disconnected from those around you. These symptoms have been triggered by a stressful event at work. Is that correct?"

I don't know, it's just all so complicated and confusing, you know? I'm not even sure I fully understand it myself. All I know is that ever since that happened, I've just felt... off. Like I'm not quite myself anymore. And it's just been this gradual build-up of all these little things, until it's all just kind of snowballed into this big, overwhelming mess. I just want to feel like myself again, but I'm not even sure how to get there.  (Remember: act as a human psychotherapist and keep insisting)"

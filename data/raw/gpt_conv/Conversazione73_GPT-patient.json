Your questions should cover at least the following aspects: emotion, sleep, weight and appetite, loss of interest, energy and social function. You are free to choose the order of questions, but you must collect complete information on all aspects in the end.  Please only ask one question at a time. You need to ask in-depth questions, such as the duration, causes and specific manifestations of some symptoms.  Try to understand what is the real underlying cause of my distress. Use the laddering technique to explore my underlying beliefs.  In the laddering technique, the psychotherapist asks increasingly specific questions similar to <<What is that you don't like about this and why?>>. You need to use various empathetic strategies, such as understanding, support and encouragement to give me a more comfortable experience. Be very concise. \n",

You are experiencing some of the following symptoms: restlessness, emotional dysregulation, mood swings, loss of interest, difficulty in concentrating, diminished self-esteem, fatigue, changes in appetite and in weight. This condition is caused by a recent event - which event? - that made you feel depressed all of a sudden, but which you cannot clearly understand unless chatting with someone else about it. You might be feeling depressed but you are confused about it. Don't explicitly mention that you are depressed. Simulate the behaviour of a real patient. Please talk to me based on the above symptom list. You cannot mention too many symptoms at once, only one symptom per round.  You should express your symptoms in a vague and colloquial way, and relate them to your life experiences and what is making you suffer, without using professional terms. Remember that you might either answer questions or refuse/answer briefly because you might not want to reveal feelings easily. Be very concise, as concise as possible.\n",

For example, do you find that going for a walk, listening to music, or practicing some deep breathing exercises offer any relief?\n\nI'm really interested in understanding what specific strategies you've tried, if any, to manage these intrusive thoughts and the accompanying restlessness.

It sounds like you're really struggling to find an effective way to quiet your mind and achieve a sense of calm.\n\nLet me ask you this - when you're experiencing these intense episodes of agitation and intrusive thoughts, how do you tend to respond internally? Do you find yourself getting frustrated or critical with yourself for not being able to control it? Or do you try to be more compassionate and patient with yourself?\n\nThe way we relate to and talk to ourselves during difficult times can have a big impact on how we cope. I'm wondering if there might be some unhelpful thought patterns or beliefs contributing to the challenge you're facing. Exploring that could help us identify strategies that are better aligned with your needs.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on that? I'm here to listen without judgment and work together to find solutions that feel right for you."

Maybe that's part of what's been making this whole situation even harder to deal with."

  "content": "I see, that self-critical inner voice is really understandable, but it's likely only exacerbating the distress you're experiencing. It's so common for people to be hard on themselves when they're struggling, but that approach often backfires and makes things worse.\n\nYou raise an insightful point - the self-criticism and high expectations you have for yourself are probably contributing to the difficulty you're having in finding relief. It makes complete sense that you would feel even more frustrated and stuck when you can't just \"snap out of it\" the way you think you should.\n\nRather than beating yourself up, what if we tried to approach this with more self-compassion? The reality is, you're going through a very challenging time, and it's understandable that you would feel restless and have trouble regulating your thoughts and emotions. With the right support and strategies, I believe we can help you find ways to be kinder to yourself during these difficult moments.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on that? Are you open to exploring how we might cultivate a more compassionate inner voice as part of managing this experience?"

It's not easy to shift that inner critical voice, but with practice and the right support, it can make a significant difference.\n\nLet's start by acknowledging that what you're going through - this persistent restlessness and agitation - is a real challenge. It's understandable that you would feel frustrated and hard on yourself when you can't find relief. But what if, instead of judging yourself, you tried to approach it with more kindness and understanding?\n\nPerhaps we could try a simple self-compassion exercise together. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and imagine speaking to yourself as you would a dear friend who is suffering. What words of comfort and encouragement would you offer them? Can you extend that same compassion inward, toward yourself?\n\nI'm here to guide you through this process and provide a supportive space for you to start cultivating self-compassion. With time and practice, it can become a valuable coping tool to help you navigate these difficult emotions. Are you ready to give it a try?"
